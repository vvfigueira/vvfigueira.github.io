\section{Concluding Remarks}

In this brief work we have shown the basics of Super Riemann Surfaces, in particular, 
beyond the definitions, we proved how the SRS can achieve the on-shell super Virasoro 
algebra, and the relations of the R sector with degeneracies of the complex 
structure of the SRS. There are more issues with SRS that are of interest to SST, 
in particular one that we haven't touched here, the moduli space. For the 
superstring, the moduli space itself is a SRS, that is, have both odd and 
even variables, and punctures --- both NS and R ones --- alter the 
dimensionality of it. This is a essential matter for the SST perturbation 
theory, as the partition function needs the integration over the moduli space, 
but sadly, to cover it also would require a much bigger work.
