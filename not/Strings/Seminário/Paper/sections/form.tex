\section{Formulation of SRS}
\label{sec:form}

% \subsection{Intuitive Description of SRS}

% As mentioned in the last section, for the action\footnote{We're going to forget about the 
% world-sheet gravitino.} \eqref{action:sst1} to be on-shell invariant under \eqref{susy:pol1}, 
% it's needed to add an auxiliary field in it. We'll try to understand why, and at the same time introduce the 
% superspace formalism. We know that the supersymmetry algebra contains a commutation relation such,
% $$\comm{Q}{Q}\propto P$$
% so that they have to be interpreted as a space-time --- in this case world-sheet --- symmetry (redundancy), 
% instead of a internal symmetry. This is interesting, because we can understand the world-sheet as being 
% the quotient group, $$\mathbb R^2\cong\mathbb C\cong ISO\qty(1,1)/SO(1,1)$$ what implies that we 
% can also understand our space-time (world-sheet) with SUSY --- Super-Space ---, as being the quotient group of the 
% Super Poincar√© group with respect to the Lorentz group, 
% $$\textnormal{Super-Space}\cong\mathbb C^{1|1}\cong ISO\qty(1,1|1)/SO(1,1)$$

% Why does this is of relevance? Due to we being able to write a generic element of the group $ISO(1,1|1)$ as,
% $$ISO(1,1|1)\ni g(\sigma,\theta,\omega)=\exp\qty(-\im \sigma_aP^a-\im \theta_A Q^A+\frac\im2\omega_{ab}J^{ab})$$
% if we factor out the Lorentz group, we obtain an expression for the elements of the Super-Space, they're 
% parametrized by two bosonic coordinates $\sigma^a$, and two fermionic coordinates $\theta^A$ --- 
% the fermionic nature is guarantee by the fermionic nature of the SUSY generators $Q^A$ ---. As 
% we're ultimately interested in the complex structure, we switch to $z,\bar z,\theta,\bar\theta$ by 
% the usual substitutions, $z=\sigma^1-\sigma^0$ and similarly for $\theta$. These coordinates we introduced 
% are useful because they allow for a differential representation of the SUSY algebra, which is analogous 
% to the differential representation of the translations which we're accustomed $P\sim L_{-1}\sim \partial_z$. 
% Inspection shows that the right choice is $Q_\theta=\partial_\theta-\theta\partial_z$, with the analogous 
% anti-holomorphic one, $$\comm{Q_\theta}{Q_\theta}=2\partial_\theta\partial_\theta-2\theta\partial_z\partial_\theta-2\partial_\theta\qty(\theta\partial_z)+2\theta\partial_z\qty(\theta\partial_z)=-2\partial_z$$
% what neatly satisfy the correct algebra. The good thing about this kind of differential representation is that 
% possesses a natural action on functions of the Super-Space --- which we'll shown in a bit ---, instead of the mysterious action in \eqref{susy:pol1}. 
% Together with this differential representation of the SUSY generator, it's useful to introduce a 
% \textit{covariant derivative} $D_\theta$, in the sense that it preserves the supersymmetry transformation 
% of the object it's acting on, $$D_\theta=\partial_\theta+\theta\partial_z,\ \ \ \comm{D_\theta}{Q_\theta}=0,\ \ \ \comm{D_\theta}{D_\theta}=2\partial_z$$
% while we'll only be able to show that this is the right choice in the next subsection, there are a few 
% motifs behind this definition. Remember, our main goal here is to obtain a geometric visualization of this 
% supersymmetry, in other words, a geometric visualization of the Super Conformal group. As we know, a conformal 
% transformation can be defined as being a coordinate change such that $\partial_z$ is changed to a 
% multiple of itself, as we already argued here, in the Super Conformal group, we have not only $z$, 
% but also $\theta$, so we need a differential operator such: (i) It commutes with the SUSY generator. 
% (ii) A Super Conformal transformation can be defined as a coordinate change $z,\theta\rightarrow z'(z,\bar z,\theta,\bar\theta),\theta'(z,\bar z,\theta,\bar\theta)$ 
% that preserves this differential operator. Notice that $\partial_z$ is consistent with condition (i), but, 
% if we try to impose condition (ii) we gain only the usual bosonic conformal transformations. Our claim is, 
% the most general differential operator that satisfy both conditions is a multiple of $D_\theta$. We'll 
% not prove here, but under such a super conformal transformation this differential operator transforms as 
% $D_\theta=\qty(D_\theta\theta')D_{\theta'}$. 

% The analogy proposes us to define Super Fields. 
% A Super Field is a function of the Super-Space $\mathbb A\qty(z,\bar z,\theta,\bar\theta)$, it's said to 
% have weights $(h,\tilde h)$ if it changes as, $$\qty(D_\theta\theta')^{2h}\qty(D_{\bar\theta}{\bar\theta}')^{2\tilde h}\mathbb A'\qty(z',\bar z',\theta',\bar\theta')=\mathbb A\qty(z,\bar z,\theta,\bar\theta)$$
% a super field turns out to be a useful construction due to the natural action of a SUSY transformation,
% $$\comm{\mathbb A\qty(z,\theta)}{Q}=-\im Q_\theta\mathbb A\qty(z,\theta)$$
% and the natural transformation of the measure,
% $$\dd[2]{z'}\dd[2]{\theta'}=\dd[2]{z}\dd[2]{\theta}D_\theta\theta'D_{\bar\theta}{\bar\theta}'$$
% which allows for a easy construction of an action, as the measure transforms as a weight $(-\frac12,-\frac12)$ 
% super field, we just need to integrate a $(\frac12,\frac12)$ super field, and as each covariant 
% derivative transforms as $(\frac12,0)$, a natural candidate is the derivative of a $(0,0)$ super field $\mathbb X^\mu$. 
% Due to the fermionic nature of the $\theta$, this can be expanded as, using a little of foresight,
% $$\mathbb X^\mu\qty(z,\bar z,\theta,\bar\theta)=X^\mu\qty(z,\bar z)+\im\theta\psi^\mu\qty(z)+\im\bar\theta{\tilde\psi}^\mu\qty(\bar z)+\bar\theta\theta F^\mu\qty(z,\bar z)$$
% here we see already our familiar fields $X^\mu,\psi^\mu$, and the presence of an additional field $F^\mu$, 
% which transforms as $(\frac12,\frac12)$, and also non trivially under the SUSY, as hinted by $Q_\theta\mathbb X^\mu$, 
% this field is necessary to ensure the off-shell SUSY invariance, and it modifies the \eqref{susy:pol1}. 
% As we mentioned before, a super conformal invariant action can be build as,
% \begin{align}
%     S&=\frac{1}{4\pi}\int\limits_\Sigma\dd[2]{z}\dd[2]{\theta}D_{\bar\theta}\mathbb X^\mu D_\theta\mathbb X_\mu\label{action:sst2}
% \end{align}
% where the fermionic integration will of course only extract the term proportional to $\bar\theta\theta$, this 
% computation is straightforward, giving,
% \begin{align*}
%     S&=\frac{1}{4\pi}\int\limits_\Sigma\dd[2]{z}\qty(\partial_zX^\mu\partial_{\bar z}X^\mu+\psi^\mu\partial_{\bar z}\psi_\mu+{\tilde\psi}^\mu\partial_z{\tilde\psi}_\mu+F^\mu F_\mu)
% \end{align*}
% exactly our starting action! With of course the auxiliary field $F^\mu$, which has the trivial equation of motion $F^\mu=0$. 
% This implies that the action \eqref{action:sst1} is just \eqref{action:sst2} with the auxiliary field integrated out.

\subsection{Formal Definition of SRS}

Now we go on to formalize the description made before, a Super Riemann Surface is a 
special kind of a complex supermanifold, we're particularly interested in SRSs of 
dimension $1|1$, let's start step by step. 
\begin{definition}
    A \textbf{complex supermanifold} $\Sigma$ of dimension $1|1$ is a space locally isomorphic 
    to $\mathbb C^{1|1}$, that is, it's locally covered by coordinate charts $z|\theta:U\subset\Sigma\rightarrow\mathbb C^{1|1}$ 
    such that $z$ is a complex even coordinate, and $\theta$ is a complex odd coordinate.
\end{definition}
The definition of a SRS is build on top of this one,
\begin{definition}
    A \textbf{Super Riemann Surface} $\Sigma$ is a complex supermanifold of dimension $1|1$ that 
    possesses a completely non-integrable dimension $0|1$ holomorphic subbundle $\mathcal D\subset T\Sigma$.
\end{definition}
This definition might hide what it's trying to convey through other definitions, so, we're going to break it 
in pieces. $T\Sigma$ is the tangent bundle/space of the supermanifold $\Sigma$, which locally is spanned by a coordinate 
basis $\partial_\theta,\partial_z$, this is exactly the same notion that we have 
in real manifolds. Now, by \textit{dimension }$0|1$\textit{ holomorphic subbundle }$\mathcal D$ we 
mean we have a closed subspace of the tangent vector field space $T\Sigma$ in which every element is 
odd. Lastly, to say $\mathcal D$ is \textit{completely non-integrable} is to say\footnote{Here $\comm{\cdot}{\cdot}$ should 
be interpreted as a graded vector field Lie Bracket.},
\begin{align*}
    \forall D\in\mathcal D\,:\, D\textnormal{ non zero }\Rightarrow D^2\coloneq\frac12\comm{D}{D}\notin\mathcal D
\end{align*}
By $D$ being non-zero it means that when it's written in a given basis $z,\theta:U\subset\Sigma\rightarrow \mathbb C^{1|1}$,
\begin{align*}
    D\textnormal{ is non zero }\Leftrightarrow D\eval_U=a\qty(z,\theta)\partial_\theta+b\qty(z,\theta)\partial_z,\ \ \ a\qty(z,\theta)\neq 0
\end{align*}
