\subsection{Supersymmetric Theories}

As mentioned in the last section, for the action\footnote{We're going to forget about the 
world-sheet gravitino.} \eqref{action:sst1} to be on-shell invariant under \eqref{susy:pol1}, 
it's needed to add an auxiliary field in it. It might not be so obvious at first sight why this is necessary, 
so we'll recall some of general developments of supersymmetric theories. It's known that the supersymmetry 
algebra is a generalization of the Poincar√© algebra
