    abstract = {A generator of a symmetry or supersymmetry of the S-matrix has to have three simple properties (see sect. 2). Starting from these properties one can give a complete analysis of the possible structure of the pseudo Lie algebra of these generators. In a theory with non-vanishing masses one finds that the only extension of previously known relations is the possible appearance of “central charges” as anticommutators of Fermi charges. In the massless case (disregarding infrared problems and symmetry breaking) the Fermi charges may generate the conformal group together with a unitary internal symmetry group.}
